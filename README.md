# MySQL-Node-js-Docker-practice-

## Overview
In this project I have implemented a simple web app using MySQL Docker container. 
* **Frontend:** 
  * **index.html:** Contains **two text boxes** to get 'Name' and 'ID', **three buttons** to apply insert, delete and update operation on database, **one text field** to show the response of the operations. No style added. 
* **Backend:**
  * **backend.js:** Written in Node.js. It performs necessary operations on the database against a click on the buttons to insert, update, delete in frontend, and sends a response message according to the result of the operations back to the frontend.
* **Database:**
  * **database.txt:** Contains necessary instructions to run a database for this project.
